            <p>CHILD LABOR</p>
            <section class="TI">
                <p>Child labor is any form of work performed by children and adolescents below the minimum age allowed by each country's legislation. In Brazil, any form of child labor is completely prohibited until the age of 14. Between 14 and 16 years old, the only legally accepted form is work as an apprentice, while from 16 to 18 years old, there is partial permission for adolescent work – however, the law prohibits any nighttime, unhealthy, hazardous, or arduous activities for children and adolescents.<br>
                    When an individual enters the labor market between the ages of 18 and 24 after a childhood marked by early work, they are likely to face greater challenges than their peers who were able to study and qualify. The lack of formal education and the scarcity of skills developed during childhood may lead these young people to accept low-paying jobs with no stability or growth prospects.

            <p>RACIAL INEQUALITY</p>
            <section class="DR">
                <p>Racial inequality is a disparity in opportunities, rights, and resources based on race or ethnicity, stemming from historical processes such as slavery and colonization. It affects areas like education, employment, health, and justice, perpetuating the marginalization of minority groups. Combating this inequality requires anti-racist education, affirmative policies, historical reparations, and the promotion of diversity. It is a structural problem that demands collective efforts.<br>

            <p>GENDER INEQUALITY</p>
            <section class="DG">
                <p>Gender inequality is the difference in rights and opportunities between men and women, visible in areas such as work, education, politics, and violence. It is sustained by cultural and historical norms and can be tackled through public policies, women's empowerment, and cultural changes.<br>
                    Paula Montagner, the Undersecretary of Labor Statistics and Studies at the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MTE), stated that women's participation in the labor market has increased in Brazil. The female participation rate rose from 34.8% in 1990 to 52.2% in 2023. It's worth noting that this figure reached 54.3% in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. The gender wage gap has also decreased over the last decade.

            <section class="DR">
                <p>The first job for 18-24 year-olds is deeply influenced by technology, from the search for opportunities on digital platforms to the need to master technical skills such as coding and online tools. Tech companies offer dynamic environments, while remote work expands geographic reach. Young people are also exploring entrepreneurship using digital resources. However, rapid technological evolution requires constant updating, facing challenges such as global competition and digital inclusion, transforming the way they start and grow their careers.

                <p>In Brazil, young people aged 18 to 24 face high unemployment rates, often above the national average, reflecting challenges such as lack of qualifications and job precarization, especially in cities like Itapetininga, where the economy is based on agriculture and commerce.<br>
                    Many enter the labor market early due to socioeconomic vulnerabilities, perpetuating a cycle of low education and limited opportunities. This scenario is linked to child labor, which deprives children of education and compromises their future.<br>
                    The infographic highlights the labor market in Itapetininga (2022), showing an 8.1% growth in formal jobs compared to the previous year. The average salary was R$ 2,575, with the services sector dominating. It also addresses:
                <ul>
                    <li>Most common occupations, such as salespeople and office assistants</li>
                    <li>Labor rights (vacations, FGTS, etc.) guaranteed by Brazilian labor law</li>
                    <li>Challenges faced, including lack of benefits and economic instability</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>It's a summary of the employment landscape in the region, focusing on progress and challenges.</p>
