        <h1>Relevance of AI</h1>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of technology that focuses on the study and creation of machines and computers that can reproduce human behavior, such as reasoning, making decisions, and acting in situations that would normally require human intelligence, from the simplest to the most complex tasks. AI is a broad field that encompasses many different disciplines, such as computer science, statistics and data analysis, hardware and software engineering, linguistics, neuroscience, and even philosophy and psychology.
            In everyday life, AI has emerged as an aid in the routines of millions of users, optimizing aspects of daily life and being adopted almost entirely by many people through the use of smart devices at home and at work, the use of self-driving cars, and the tireless use of social networks, search and shopping sites, among other AI models that ensure greater practicality in everyday life.</p>

        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the corporate landscape by providing:
            Improved decision-making: By analyzing large volumes of data, AI generates insights that improve business strategies and decisions in areas such as HR, where it facilitates hiring aligned with the corporate culture.
            Operational transformation: Automates repetitive tasks, increasing efficiency, reducing errors and freeing up human resources for more strategic and innovative activities.
            Customer personalization and experience: Enables highly personalized marketing and service, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.
            Improved security: Identifies and prevents cyber and physical threats with intelligent algorithms.
            Sustainability and energy efficiency: Optimizes resources and reduces waste, promoting more sustainable practices.
            Skills improvement and job creation: Creates new job categories and demand for specialization, such as data analysis, while AI-based platforms offer continuous and personalized training.
            Improved working conditions: Replaces humans in dangerous tasks, improving safety in the workplace.
            While AI changes the nature of jobs, it also opens up opportunities for innovation and growth, highlighting its role as a transformative force in business.</p>

        <h1>Challenges</h1>
            </section>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) affects some of the current jobs, but it also opens up opportunities for workers and entrepreneurs, according to experts gathered this Tuesday (9) at the Chamber of Deputies.
            They participated in the debate “Professions at Risk: Artificial Intelligence and Employability”. Deputy Helio Lopes (PL-RJ), rapporteur of an ongoing study at the Center for Strategic Studies and Debates (Cedes), coordinated the meeting.
            “The net result of the impacts of artificial intelligence is uncertain, it will depend on companies and workers”, summarized Marcello Luiz de Souza Junior, one of the managers in São Paulo of the National Industrial Training Service (Senai).
            The research indicates that 37% of jobs in Brazil are exposed to generative artificial intelligence, which means that this portion may undergo significant changes in the way they work.</p>

        <h1>Relationship between Technology and First Job</h1>
            </section>
        <p>Technology has a significant impact on first jobs, expanding opportunities and requiring new skills.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>Easy access: Digital platforms and social networks help young people find jobs.</p></li>
        <li><p>Emerging sectors: Areas such as IT, digital marketing and the sharing economy offer accessible jobs.</p></li>
        <li><p>Digital skills: Basic tools and technological knowledge are essential even in traditional jobs.</p></li>
        <li><p>Online training: Free courses and institutions such as SENAI prepare young people for the technology market.</p></li>
        <li><p>Challenges and opportunities: While technology increases competition, it also promotes innovation, automation and remote work.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Technology not only expands opportunities for first jobs, but also defines many of the skills needed to enter the market. Young people who quickly adapt to tools and innovations have a better chance of success, especially in a scenario where digital transformation is constant. Technological training, therefore, is an indispensable differentiator.</p>

        <h1>Humanization of technology</h1>
            </section>
            <p>Over the next five years, 85% of business interactions are expected to be influenced by AI, forever changing the way operations happen. The key to success, however, will be finding the balance between efficient automation and human personalization. Companies that can harness the power of AI, without losing the human touch, will be at the forefront of the new era of business, able to create more meaningful connections with their customers.</p>
            <p>“Like everything in life, the secret is in balance! Using AI as a support tool for repetitive, analytical tasks or taking a first step in a new project is valid, but, at the same time, it is necessary to maintain a sharp, strategic and creative eye to ensure the human touch in interactions, creations and content”, explains journalist and social media, Stephanie Friesen, social media coordinator at the Smartcom agency.</p>
